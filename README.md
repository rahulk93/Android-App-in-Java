In this repository, I have created a simple Android application with clicking button functionality. This functionality calculates how many times has the button has been 
clicked by the user. 

In order to run my application on Android Studios tool, I had to enable virtualization in BIOS. 

<ins>**Instructions on how to enable virtualization in BIOS for Android App**</ins>

-	Go to Windows Settings
- Click on Update & Security
-	Now click on Recovery
-	Click Restart now under Advanced startup.Advanced startup
-	Go to Troubleshoot
-	Click on Advanced Options
-	Now click on UEFI Firmware Settings
-	Click Restart.

Restart into BIOS Settings

This method only works if you use UEFI-boot. And this is also a setting that can be changed from the BIOS. If you don’t know this, you don’t have to worry about it. 
All Windows PCs ship with UEFI boot enabled by default.

Enable Virtualization in BIOS

Look for something like an Advanced menu or tab. You’ll most likely find the setting you need to turn on under this. In addition to all the other things that can be different, this can also be labeled differently. It could be Advanced Mode, or simply Configuration like it is on my Lenovo Ideapad.

Finally, look for the setting which has Virtualization is its name and turn it on.

**What I learnt while making this application above:** In this programme, I learnt how to make buttons and add functionality to it. I understand how to change text in order to record how many times button has been clicked by user. I have also learnt how enable virtualization in BIOS in order to make Android app running.  

**How might I improve:** Researching and adding more interesting funtionality.
